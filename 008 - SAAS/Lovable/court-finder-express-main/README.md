## Intro
The code in this repo is the output from Lovable. The code was produced was from prompting only as an investigation to the rol of SaaS AI tooling within a Full Service Development Initiative for HMCTS.

Lovable is an AI-powered app builder designed to allow users to create web applications
through conversation and prompts, essentially a next-generation no-code tool. It was born
from the open-source GPT-Engineer project and evolved into a commercial product that
allows you to “chat to build” real apps.

Lovable’s core idea is that “creating software has never been more accessible” – you
describe what you want in natural language, and the AI generates a working application
instantly (Lovable).
