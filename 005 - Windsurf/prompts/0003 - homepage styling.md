## INPUT
Can you make this page look like the home page of https://www.find-court-tribunal.service.gov.uk/

## OUTPUT
I'll help you make the home page look like the one from find-court-tribunal.service.gov.uk. Let me first check the content of the reference website:

Read page

Now let me check what the current template structure looks like:

Analyzed

template.njk:(1-200)
Let me check if there are any existing GOV.UK components or styles that I can use:

Searched filesystem
9 results
Searchedinsrc/main/viewswith pattern*.njk
Let me check if there are any existing CSS files that might be relevant:

Searched filesystem
5 results
Searchedinsrc/main/assetswith pattern*
Now I'll update the home.njk file to match the look and feel of the find-court-tribunal.service.gov.uk home page:

Great! The server is running. Let's open a browser preview to see the changes:

BetaRunning Preview:

Find Court or Tribunal App

Open Preview
Open in External Browser

I've updated the home page to match the look and feel of the Find a Court or Tribunal service website. The page now includes:

A main heading "Find a Court or Tribunal"
A description of the service
A bulleted list of what users can find (address, contact details, etc.)
A prominent "Start now" button with the GOV.UK arrow icon
A "Before you search" section with information about:
Welsh language availability
Northern Ireland restrictions
Scotland service limitations
Links to relevant external services
All of these elements use the GOV.UK Design System classes for consistent styling and accessibility.

You can view the changes by clicking the "Open in browser" button in the browser preview above, or by navigating to https://localhost:3100 in your browser.

The page now closely resembles the Find a Court or Tribunal service home page while maintaining the structure and styling conventions of your application. The "Start now" button currently links to "#" - we can update this to point to the appropriate page once we know where it should lead.

Would you like me to make any additional changes to the home page?

## SUCCESS
Yes

## RESULT
Successfully updated the home page to match the look and feel of the Find a Court or Tribunal service. The user confirmed the changes look great.
