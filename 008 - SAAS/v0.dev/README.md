# v0.dev

## Intro
Vercel’s v0 offers an AI-powered chat interface designed for front-end development,
enabling users to simply type commands such as ”Create a signup form with email and
password fields” and receive fully functional React/Next.js code in return. This prompt-
based system, which asks ”What can I help you ship?”, makes it possible for even those
without programming skills to create web UI components and pages. By translating
natural language requests directly into live components, it simplifies the development
process and speeds up prototyping
## How to run

```shell
npm i --legacy-peer-deps
npm run dev
```
