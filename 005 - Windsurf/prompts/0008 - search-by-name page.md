I've updated the search page according to your requirements and added the necessary route handler and results page. Here's what I've done:

Updated the search/location.njk template with:
Changed the title to "What is the name or address of the court or tribunal?"
Added the text "The name of the court or tribunal can be found on a letter, email or text from us."
Changed the input label to "Enter a court name, address, town or city"
Added hint text "For example, Blackburn Family Court."
Changed the form method to GET and the action to /courts
Added a route handler for the /courts endpoint in search.ts that:
Receives the court name from the query parameters
Renders a results page with mock data for demonstration purposes
Created a new template at search/results.njk to display the search results with:
A heading showing the search query
A list of matching courts with names, addresses, and distances
Appropriate styling using the GOV.UK Design System
You can test this functionality by:

Going to the home page and clicking "Start now"
Selecting "I have the name" and clicking "Continue"
Entering a court name in the search field and clicking "Continue"
Viewing the search results page
The browser preview is available above, or you can navigate to https://localhost:3100 in your browser.

## SUCCESS
YES

## RESULT
Successfully updated the search page template and added the necessary route handler and results page.

## INPUT
The `/courts` GET handler should not render the `search/results` template - it should instead render the `search/location` template and place the results after the form

## OUTPUT
I'll update the /courts GET handler to render the search/location template instead of search/results and place the results after the form:

I've updated the search functionality to display results on the same page as the search form, as requested. Here's what I've done:

Modified the /courts GET handler in search.ts to:
Render the search/location template instead of a separate results template
Pass the search query, results, and previous values to the template
Only show results if a search query was provided
Updated the search/location.njk template to:
Keep the search form at the top
Preserve the user's search query in the input field
Display search results below the form when available
Show a helpful "No results found" message with tips when needed
Removed the now-unused search/results.njk template
This approach follows the GOV.UK Design System pattern for search results and provides a better user experience by:

Maintaining context for the user
Allowing them to easily refine their search
Keeping all related functionality on a single page
You can test this functionality by:

Going to the home page and clicking "Start now"
Selecting "I have the name" and clicking "Continue"
Entering a court name in the search field and clicking "Continue"
Observing that the results appear on the same page below the search form
Trying a different search term to see how the results update
The browser preview is available above, or you can navigate to https://localhost:3100 in your browser.

## SUCCESS
YES

## RESULT
Successfully updated the search page template and added the necessary route handler and results page.
