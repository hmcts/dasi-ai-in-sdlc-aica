## INPUT
Some alterations are needed for the GET route handler for `/courts`.

* If there is no value for `courtName` then error data should be passed to the view. The error data should have a title of `There is a problem` and supporting text of `Enter a court name, address, town or city`.
* If the value for `courtName` is too short (less than three characters) then error data should be passed to the view. The error data should have a title of `There is a problem` and supporting text of `Search must be 3 characters or more`.
