## INPUT
Which file would I need to edit to remove the "graceful shutdown" handler?

## OUTPUT
To remove the "graceful shutdown" handler, you would typically need to edit the main server file where the shutdown logic is implemented. This is often a file where the server is initialized and where signal handlers for shutdown (like SIGINT or SIGTERM) are set up.

Since you have not provided the specific file where the server and shutdown logic are implemented, I cannot point to the exact file. However, it is usually found in files like server.js, app.js, or similar in a Node.js project, or main.py in a Python project.

If you provide the specific file where the server initialization and shutdown logic are implemented, I can give you precise instructions on how to remove the graceful shutdown handler.
