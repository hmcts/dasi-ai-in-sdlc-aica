## INPUT
Can you remove the graceful shutdown handler please?

## OUTPUT
I'll help remove the graceful shutdown handler. Let me first search the codebase to locate where it's implemented.
Now I can see the graceful shutdown handler is located in src/main/server.ts. Let me check the full content of this file to make sure I understand how it's implemented before removing it.
Now let me also check the health.ts file to understand the related shutdown check functionality:
Now I'll edit the server.ts file to remove the graceful shutdown handler and its event listeners:
Now I need to update the health.ts file to remove the shutdown check, since the app.locals.shutdown variable is no longer being set:
Let me fix the unused import in health.ts:
Oops, I accidentally changed the wrong import. Let me fix this:
I've successfully removed the graceful shutdown handler from your application by:
Removing the gracefulShutdownHandler function and the associated signal listeners (SIGINT, SIGTERM) from src/main/server.ts
Removing the shutdownCheck function and related readiness check from src/main/routes/health.ts
Removing the app.locals.shutdown = false initialization from src/main/server.ts
These changes eliminate the graceful shutdown functionality while maintaining the basic health checks.
