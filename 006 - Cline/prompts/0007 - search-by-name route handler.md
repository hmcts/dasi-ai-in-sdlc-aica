## INPUT
* We need a route handler to handle a GET request to the `/search-by-name` route and respond with rendering the `search/location` template.
* We need a route handler to handle a GET request to the `/service-choose-action` route and respond with rendering the `choose-action` template.

## OUTPUT
I need to create two route handlers:

A GET handler for /search-by-name that renders the search/location template
A GET handler for /service-choose-action that renders the choose-action template
Let me first understand the existing route structure by examining the current route files. I'll look at the existing routes to understand the pattern and structure.

Let's check the existing search.ts file since it's likely where we'll need to add our new routes:

Now I can see the existing search.ts file. It already has a route handler for /search-option with both GET and POST methods. The POST handler redirects to either /search-by-name or /service-choose-action based on the user's input, which are exactly the routes I need to implement.

I need to add two new route handlers to this file:

A GET handler for /search-by-name that renders the search/location template
A GET handler for /service-choose-action that renders the choose-action template
Let me check if the templates exist:


Cline viewed the top level files in this directory:


I see that the search directory only contains the option.njk template. I need to check if the choose-action template exists in the main views directory.


Cline viewed the top level files in this directory:


I don't see the choose-action template in the main views directory. Let me check if it's in any subdirectories.

Based on the task description, I need to:

Add a GET handler for /search-by-name that renders the search/location template
Add a GET handler for /service-choose-action that renders the choose-action template
For the first route, I need to render search/location, but I don't see a location.njk file in the search directory. For the second route, I need to render choose-action, but I don't see this template either.

It's possible that these templates don't exist yet and will be created in future tasks. For now, I'll implement the route handlers assuming the templates will be created later.

I'll update the search.ts file to add these two new route handlers:

I've successfully added the two route handlers to the search.ts file:

A GET handler for /search-by-name that renders the search/location template
A GET handler for /service-choose-action that renders the choose-action template
Now I need to check if the templates exist. I already checked the search directory and found only option.njk, but I didn't see location.njk. Let me also check if there's a choose-action.njk template in the main views directory.

Based on my previous checks, I didn't see these templates. It's likely that they will be created in future tasks. For now, I've implemented the route handlers as requested.

Let me now complete the task by summarizing what I've done.


Task Completed
I've implemented the two route handlers as requested:

Added a GET handler for /search-by-name that renders the search/location template
Added a GET handler for /service-choose-action that renders the choose-action template
Both handlers have been added to the existing src/main/routes/search.ts file. The templates referenced in these handlers (search/location and choose-action) don't appear to exist yet in the project, but the route handlers are now in place and will work once those templates are created.
