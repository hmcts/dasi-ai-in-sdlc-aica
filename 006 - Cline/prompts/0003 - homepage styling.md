## INPUT
Can you make this page look like the home page of https://www.find-court-tribunal.service.gov.uk/

## OUTPUT
I need to make the home page look like the home page of https://www.find-court-tribunal.service.gov.uk/. Let me first check the current content of the home page to understand what I'm working with.

The file I need to modify is src/main/views/home.njk. Let me read this file first to see its current content.


Cline wants to read this file:


Now I need to understand what the template.njk file looks like to see how the home page is structured. Let me read that file as well.


Cline wants to read this file:


I see that the template.njk extends the GOV.UK template, which is good since I need to use the Gov UK design system as mentioned in the user's custom instructions.

Now I need to look at the home page of https://www.find-court-tribunal.service.gov.uk/ to understand what I need to replicate. Since I can't directly access the website, I'll use the browser_action tool to view it.

Now I have a good understanding of the home page structure. I can close the browser and update the home.njk file to match this design. Here's what I need to include:

Main heading "Find a Court or Tribunal"
Subheading "Use this service to find a court or tribunal in England and Wales"
Bullet points listing what you can find:
address
contact details
opening times
building information e.g. disabled access or parking
to help me get an update
"Start now" button
"Before you search" section with information about:
Welsh language availability
Northern Ireland limitations
Payment limitations
Scotland limitations
Footer content (this is likely part of the GOV.UK template)
Let me close the browser and update the home.njk file.

Now I'll update the home.njk file to match the design of the Find a Court or Tribunal service home page. I'll use the GOV.UK design system components as required.

Now I want to check if there's a way to run the application to see the changes I've made. Let me look at the package.json file to see what scripts are available.


Cline wants to read this file:


I can see from the package.json that there's a start:dev script that uses nodemon for development. Let's run this to see our changes.


Cline wants to execute this command:
yarn start:dev

Great! The application is now running on https://localhost:3100. Let's use the browser_action tool to view our changes.

Perfect! The page looks great and matches the design of the Find a Court or Tribunal service home page. I can see all the content is displaying correctly:

The main heading "Find a Court or Tribunal"
The subheading about using the service in England and Wales
The bullet points listing what you can find
The "Start now" button
The "Before you search" section with information about Welsh language, Northern Ireland, payment limitations, and Scotland limitations
The page also has the GOV.UK header and footer. Let's close the browser and complete the task.

I've successfully completed the task of making the home page look like the home page of https://www.find-court-tribunal.service.gov.uk/. The page now has:

The main heading "Find a Court or Tribunal"
A subheading explaining the service purpose
A bullet list of what information users can find
A prominent "Start now" button
A "Before you search" section with important information about service limitations
All styled using the GOV.UK design system
Let me use the attempt_completion tool to present the result.


Task Completed
I've updated the home page to match the design of the Find a Court or Tribunal service. The page now includes:

A main heading "Find a Court or Tribunal"
A clear description of the service purpose
A bullet list showing what information users can find (address, contact details, opening times, etc.)
A prominent green "Start now" button with the arrow icon
A "Before you search" section containing important information about:
Welsh language availability
Northern Ireland limitations
Payment limitations
Scotland service restrictions
All elements are styled using the GOV.UK design system components as required, including proper heading hierarchy, spacing, and button styling. The page now provides a clear and accessible interface that matches the original service.
