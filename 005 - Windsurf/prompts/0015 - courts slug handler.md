## INPUT
We need a route handler to handle a GET request to the `/courts/:slug` route and respond with rendering the `court-details/not-in-person-court` template. The template will need data from the `getCourtBySlug` method.

The data from the `getCourtBySlug` method will need some alteration before being passed to the template:
* A `title` property should be added with `${courtDetails.name} - Find a Court or Tribunal - GOV.UK`
* The `image_file` property should have `https://factaat.blob.core.windows.net/images/` prepended to it
* If the property `courtDetails.service_centre.intro_paragraph` exists then the data should be updated with a property of `notInPersonP1` with the same value.
* If the property `courtDetails.service_centre.intro_paragraph` does not exist then the `notInPersonP1` property should equal `This location services all of England and Wales for ${courtDetails.areas_of_law.map(a => a.name).join(', ')}. We do not provide an in-person service.`;

If the data has a truthy value for `in_person` then we should render the template `court-details/in-person-court` instead of `court-details/not-in-person-court`

## OUTPUT
I'll create a route handler for the /courts/:slug route that will fetch court details using the getCourtBySlug method and render the appropriate template based on the court's in-person status. Let's start by examining the existing routes structure.

Great! The getCourtBySlug method is already implemented in the factAPI.ts file. Let's test our implementation by running the application:

Let's create a memory to document what we've implemented:

I've successfully implemented the route handler for the /courts/:slug endpoint as requested. Here's a summary of what I've done:

Created a new route handler in search.ts that:
Fetches court details using the getCourtBySlug method
Prepares the data for the template, including:
Setting a title for the page
Adding the proper URL prefix to the image_file
Adding a notInPersonP1 property for non-in-person courts
Conditionally renders either the in-person-court or not-in-person-court template based on the court's inPerson status
Created two Nunjucks templates following the GOV.UK Design System:
court-details/in-person-court.njk for in-person courts, which includes:
Court details
Contact information
Opening times
Building facilities
Map integration (if coordinates are available)
court-details/not-in-person-court.njk for non-in-person courts, with a simpler layout
Updated the Court interface in factApiTypes.ts to include the notInPersonP1 property to fix TypeScript errors.
The application is now running and you can access the court details page by navigating to /courts/{slug} where {slug} is the slug of a specific court.

To test this functionality, you can:

Search for a court using the search functionality
Click on a court from the search results, which should navigate to the court details page
Verify that the appropriate template is rendered based on the court's in-person status

## SUCCESS
YES

## RESULT
Windsurf created the handler and templates

## OBSERVATIONS
* 1 out of 1 successful
* Windsurf maintained strong-typing.
* Windsurf added error-handling.
* Windsurf designed target templates
* Windsurf verified that the server is still running and restarted it if needed.
* Windsurf provided a browser preview to see the changes. (which didn't work)
