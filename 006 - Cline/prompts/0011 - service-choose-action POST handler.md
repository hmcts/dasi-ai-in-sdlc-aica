## INPUT
Can you add a POST route handler for `/service-choose-action`, the payload is JSON with the result from a single radio-button called `action`.

* When the value of `action` is one of 'nearest', 'documents', 'update' or 'not-listed' then it should redirect to `'/services/' + action`.
* Otherwise we should redirect to `/service-choose-action`

## OUTPUT
I need to add a POST route handler for /service-choose-action that processes a JSON payload with a radio button value called action. Based on the value of action, it should redirect to different routes.

Let me first understand the current structure of the project. I can see that there's a file src/main/routes/search.ts which is currently open in the editor. This might contain similar route handlers that I can use as a reference. Let me check this file first.

I should also look at the view file src/main/views/choose-action.njk to understand the form structure that will be submitting to this route.

Let's start by reading these files.

Now I need to check the choose-action.njk file to understand the form structure that will be submitting to this route.


Cline wants to read this file:


I see that the form in choose-action.njk is currently using a GET method, but the task is to add a POST route handler. I'll need to modify the form to use POST instead of GET, and then add the POST route handler to the search.ts file.

The form has radio buttons with the name "action" and values "nearest", "documents", "update", and "not-listed". According to the task:

When the value of action is one of 'nearest', 'documents', 'update' or 'not-listed' then it should redirect to '/services/' + action.
Otherwise we should redirect to /service-choose-action
Let me make these changes:

First, I'll update the form in choose-action.njk to use POST method
Then I'll add the POST route handler to search.ts

Now I need to add the POST route handler to the search.ts file. Based on the task requirements:

When the value of action is one of 'nearest', 'documents', 'update' or 'not-listed' then it should redirect to '/services/' + action.
Otherwise we should redirect to /service-choose-action
I'll add this handler after the existing GET route for /service-choose-action.

I've successfully completed the task:

I changed the form method in choose-action.njk from GET to POST.
I added a POST route handler for /service-choose-action in search.ts that:
Extracts the action value from the request body
Redirects to /services/[action] if the action is one of 'nearest', 'documents', 'update', or 'not-listed'
Otherwise redirects back to /service-choose-action
The implementation matches the requirements specified in the task. Now I can use the attempt_completion tool to summarize what I've done.


Task Completed
I've implemented the POST route handler for /service-choose-action as requested:

Modified the form in choose-action.njk to use POST method instead of GET
Added a POST route handler in search.ts that:
Extracts the action value from the request body
Redirects to /services/[action] when the value is one of 'nearest', 'documents', 'update', or 'not-listed'
Otherwise redirects back to /service-choose-action
The implementation follows the specified requirements and handles the form submission from the radio button selection.
