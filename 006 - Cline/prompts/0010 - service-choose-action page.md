## INPUT
Please create a nunjucks View in a `./src/main/views/choose-action` file - it should use the Gov UK styling and the page will ask the user "What do you want to do?"

Please can we alter the page so that:
* The title reads `What do you want to do?`
* The first radio-button says `Find the nearest court or tribunal` - with a value of `nearest`.
* The second radio-button says `Find a court or tribunal to send documents to` with a value of `documents`
* The third radio-button says `Contact a court or tribunal to get an update on your application` with a value of `update`
* There is then a divider that says `or`
* The final radio-button says `It is not listed here` with a value of `not-listed`
* The enclosing `form` should GET to `/service-choose-action`

## OUTPUT
I need to create a Nunjucks view file that follows the Gov UK design system. The file should be created at ./src/main/views/choose-action and should contain a form with radio buttons for different actions a user can take.

Let me analyze what I need to do:

First, I should check if the directory ./src/main/views/choose-action exists. If not, I'll need to create it.
Then, I need to create a Nunjucks template file in that directory.
The template should use Gov UK styling.
The template should have a form with radio buttons as specified in the task.
Let me first check if the directory exists by listing the files in the ./src/main/views directory.


Cline viewed the top level files in this directory:


I see that the ./src/main/views directory exists, but there's no choose-action directory yet. I'll need to create this directory and then create the Nunjucks template file inside it.

Before I create the file, I should check what the Gov UK design system looks like in this project. Let me look at an existing template file to understand the structure and styling being used. I'll check the home.njk file as a reference.


Cline wants to read this file:


I see that the home.njk file extends "template.njk" and uses Gov UK design system classes like "govuk-width-container", "govuk-main-wrapper", "govuk-heading-xl", etc.

Now, I need to check if there are any existing radio button implementations in the project to understand how they're structured. Let me look at the search option page since it might have form elements.


Cline wants to read this file:


Perfect! I found an example of a form with radio buttons in the option.njk file. This gives me a good template to follow for creating the choose-action page.

Now I need to check if there's any existing implementation of a divider in the Gov UK design system used in this project. Let me also check the template.njk file to understand the base template structure.


Cline wants to read this file:


I see that the template.njk extends "govuk/template.njk", which is likely part of the Gov UK design system. Now I have a good understanding of the project structure and how to implement the choose-action page.

Let me check if there's a govuk directory in the views folder to see if there are any additional components I can reference.


Cline viewed the top level files in this directory:


Great, I see there's a govuk/components directory. Let me check what components are available there, as there might be a divider component I can use.


Cline viewed the top level files in this directory:


I see there's a radios component directory, which is what I need for the radio buttons. I don't see a specific divider component, but I can use other components like inset-text or create a simple divider using CSS classes.

Let me check the radios component to see if there's any specific implementation I should follow.


Cline viewed the top level files in this directory:


Great, I can see there's a radios component with a template.njk file. Let me check if there's a divider component or something similar I can use for the "or" divider.

Based on the information I have, I now have a good understanding of how to create the choose-action page. I'll create a new file at ./src/main/views/choose-action/index.njk with the following structure:

Extend the template.njk
Create a form with a GET method to "/service-choose-action"
Include the CSRF macro
Add the radio buttons as specified in the task
Add a divider with "or" text
Add the final radio button
Add a continue button
Now I'll create the file.

I've successfully created the Nunjucks view file at ./src/main/views/choose-action/index.njk with all the required elements:

The title reads "What do you want to do?"
The first radio button says "Find the nearest court or tribunal" with a value of "nearest"
The second radio button says "Find a court or tribunal to send documents to" with a value of "documents"
The third radio button says "Contact a court or tribunal to get an update on your application" with a value of "update"
There is a divider that says "or"
The final radio button says "It is not listed here" with a value of "not-listed"
The form uses the GET method to "/service-choose-action"
The file follows the Gov UK design system styling and structure, similar to other pages in the project. Now I can complete the task.


Task Completed
I've created the Nunjucks view file at ./src/main/views/choose-action/index.njk with the following features:

The page title is set to "What do you want to do?"
The form includes four radio button options:
"Find the nearest court or tribunal" (value: nearest)
"Find a court or tribunal to send documents to" (value: documents)
"Contact a court or tribunal to get an update on your application" (value: update)
"It is not listed here" (value: not-listed)
There is a divider with the text "or" before the last option
The form uses the GET method to submit to "/service-choose-action"
The view follows the Gov UK design system styling and maintains consistency with the existing application structure.

## SUCCESS
MIXED

## RESULT
It created the view, but at the wrong location

## INPUT
Can we move the file at `./src/main/views/choose-action/index.njk` to `./src/main/views/choose-action.njk`

## OUTPUT
I need to move a file from one location to another. Let me analyze what needs to be done:

The source file is at ./src/main/views/choose-action/index.njk
The destination is ./src/main/views/choose-action.njk
This is a simple file move operation. I'll need to:

Read the content of the source file
Create the destination file with the same content
Delete the source file (and possibly the directory if it becomes empty)
Let me start by reading the content of the source file.

I'll move the file from ./src/main/views/choose-action/index.njk to ./src/main/views/choose-action.njk. First, let me read the content of the source file.


Cline wants to read this file:


Now that I have the content of the source file, I need to:

Create the destination file with the same content
Delete the source file and possibly the directory if it becomes empty
Let me first create the destination file with the same content.

Now I'll create the new file at the destination path with the same content.

Now that I've successfully created the destination file, I need to delete the source file. Since the file is in a directory, I should also check if the directory will be empty after deleting the file, and if so, remove the directory as well.

Let me first check if there are any other files in the source directory.

Now I'll check if there are any other files in the source directory before removing it.


Cline viewed the top level files in this directory:


I can see that the only file in the src/main/views/choose-action directory is index.njk. This means that after deleting this file, the directory will be empty and can be removed as well.

Now I'll execute a command to:

Delete the source file
Remove the empty directory
I'll use the rm command with the -r flag to recursively remove the directory and its contents.

Now I'll remove the original file and its directory since it will be empty after the file is deleted.


Cline wants to execute this command:
rm -r src/main/views/choose-action
The model has determined this command requires explicit approval.

Restore


Now I've successfully:

Read the content of the source file at ./src/main/views/choose-action/index.njk
Created the destination file at ./src/main/views/choose-action.njk with the same content
Removed the source file and its directory
The file has been successfully moved from ./src/main/views/choose-action/index.njk to ./src/main/views/choose-action.njk. Let me verify that the file exists at the new location.

I can see from the VSCode Open Tabs that src/main/views/choose-action.njk is now open, which confirms that the file exists at the new location.

I should now use the attempt_completion tool to inform the user that the task has been completed.


Task Completed
I've successfully moved the file from ./src/main/views/choose-action/index.njk to ./src/main/views/choose-action.njk. The original directory has been removed since it's now empty.

## SUCCESS
YES

## RESULT
It made the change exactly as requested
