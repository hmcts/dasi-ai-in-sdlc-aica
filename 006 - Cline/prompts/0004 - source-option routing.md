#can we add a new file for an Express router to handle the `/` route?

In the file I want a handler for the GET request of `/search-option` which should render the `search/option` nunjucks template

## OUTPUT
I need to create a new Express router file to handle the / route, specifically for the GET request to /search-option which should render the search/option nunjucks template.

Let's analyze the project structure to understand where to place this new file and how to structure it:

The project appears to be an Express.js application with TypeScript.
Existing route files are in src/main/routes/ directory (e.g., health.ts, home.ts, info.ts).
The views are in src/main/views/ directory.
First, I should check the existing route files to understand the pattern they follow. Let's look at src/main/routes/home.ts as a reference:

I'll create a new Express router file to handle the /search-option route. First, let me check the existing route files to understand the pattern they follow.

Now I understand the pattern used for route files in this project. The home.ts file exports a default function that takes an Express Application instance and registers routes on it. In this case, it registers a GET handler for the root path (/) that renders the 'home' template.

I need to create a similar file for handling the /search-option route. Let's also check if the search/option nunjucks template exists or if I need to create it as well.

Let me check if the search/option nunjucks template already exists:


Cline viewed the top level files in this directory:


I see that the src/main/views/search directory doesn't exist yet. I'll need to create both the router file and the template directory/file.

Let's create the router file first. Based on the pattern in home.ts, I'll create a new file called search.ts in the src/main/routes directory. This file will handle the /search-option route and render the search/option template.

The router file should:

Import the necessary dependencies
Export a default function that takes an Express Application instance
Register a GET handler for the /search-option route that renders the search/option template
Let's create this file:

Now that I've created the router file, I need to create the template file. The template should be located at src/main/views/search/option.njk.

Since the user mentioned using the Gov UK design system for Nunjucks templates, I should structure the template accordingly. Let me check the existing templates to understand the pattern they follow.

Now I'll create the directory and template file for the search option page:


Cline wants to read this file:


Now I understand the template structure. The home template extends "template.njk" and uses the Gov UK design system components like govuk-heading-xl, govuk-body, govuk-list, govuk-button, etc.

Let me create the search/option.njk template following a similar pattern. I'll need to:

Create the directory structure: src/main/views/search/
Create the file: src/main/views/search/option.njk
Structure it to extend template.njk and use Gov UK design system components
For the content, I'll create a simple search option page that fits with the "Find a Court or Tribunal" theme of the application.

Now I'll create the directory and template file for the search option page:

Now I need to check if I need to update the main application file to register the new router. Let me check the app.ts file to see how routes are registered:

Let me check how routes are registered in the application:


Cline wants to read this file:


I see that the application automatically loads all route files from the /routes directory using glob:

glob
  .sync(__dirname + '/routes/**/*.+(ts|js)')
  .map(filename => require(filename))
  .forEach(route => route.default(app));
This means that our new search.ts route file will be automatically loaded and registered with the application. We don't need to make any additional changes to the app.ts file.

Let's verify that we've completed all the requirements:

✅ Created a new Express router file at src/main/routes/search.ts
✅ Added a handler for the GET request to /search-option that renders the search/option nunjucks template
✅ Created the search/option nunjucks template using the Gov UK design system
Everything is in place. Let's summarize what we've done and complete the task.


Task Completed
I've created a new Express router file to handle the /search-option route:

Created src/main/routes/search.ts with a GET handler for /search-option that renders the search/option template
Created the directory structure and template file at src/main/views/search/option.njk using the Gov UK design system
The template includes a form with radio buttons for different search options (by name, postcode, or address)
The router will be automatically loaded by the application since it uses glob to find and register all route files in the routes directory. No additional configuration is needed.

## SUCCESS
Yes

## RESULT
It created the routing correctly and a good template page.

## INPUT
Can you update the `Continue` button on the home page to link to the `/search-option` route?

## OUTPUT
I need to update the Continue button on the home page to link to the /search-option route. Let's first examine the home page to understand its current structure and how the button is implemented.

I'll use the read_file tool to look at the home page template:


Cline wants to read this file:


Now I can see the home page template. I need to update the "Start now" button which is currently linking to "#" to instead link to the "/search-option" route.

Let's also check the search routes file to confirm the route exists:


Cline wants to read this file:


Great, I can confirm that the /search-option route exists and it renders the 'search/option' template.

Now I need to update the home.njk file to change the "Start now" button's href from "#" to "/search-option". I'll use the replace_in_file tool to make this change.

I've successfully updated the home page by:

Changing the button's href from "#" to "/search-option"
Changing the button text from "Start now" to "Continue"
The changes have been applied successfully. Now I can complete the task.


Task Completed
I've updated the home page by:

Changed the "Start now" button text to "Continue"
Updated the button's link to point to the "/search-option" route instead of "#"
The button now correctly links to the search option page, allowing users to proceed with the court or tribunal search flow.

## SUCCESS
YES

## RESULT
The page was updated successfully
