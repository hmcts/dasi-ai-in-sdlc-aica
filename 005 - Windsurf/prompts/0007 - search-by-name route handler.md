## INPUT
* We need a route handler to handle a GET request to the `/search-by-name` route and respond with rendering the `search/location` template.
* We need a route handler to handle a GET request to the `/service-choose-action` route and respond with rendering the `choose-action` template.

## OUTPUT
I'll add the requested route handlers to the search.ts file and create the necessary template files. Let me start by updating the search.ts file:

Let's check if the server is still running and restart it if needed:

Ran terminal command
~/Downloads/AI-IN-THE-SDLC/005 - Windsurf
Go to terminal
$ lsof -i :3100

Auto-run
The server is running. Let's provide a browser preview to see the changes:

I've successfully implemented the requested route handlers and created the necessary template files:

Added two new route handlers to the search.ts file:
A GET handler for /search-by-name that renders the search/location template
A GET handler for /service-choose-action that renders the choose-action template
Created the required template files:
src/main/views/search/location.njk - A form for searching courts by name with:
A heading "Find a court or tribunal by name"
A text input field for entering the court name
A "Continue" button
src/main/views/choose-action.njk - A form for choosing what action to take with:
A heading "What would you like to do?"
Radio buttons for two options:
"Get information about a court or tribunal"
"Get an update on a case"
A "Continue" button
Both templates follow the GOV.UK Design System patterns for forms, typography, and styling to ensure consistency and accessibility.

You can test these routes by:

Going to the home page and clicking "Start now"
Selecting "I have the name" and clicking "Continue" to go to the search-by-name page
Alternatively, you can directly navigate to /service-choose-action to see that page
The browser preview is available above, or you can navigate to https://localhost:3100 in your browser.

## SUCCESS
YES

## RESULT
Successfully added the requested route handlers and created the necessary template files.

## OBSERVATIONS
* 1 out of 1 successful
* Windsurf created the GET handlers for the /search-by-name and /service-choose-action routes.
* Windsurf created the required template files.
* Windsurf verified that the server is still running and restarted it if needed.
* Windsurf provided a browser preview to see the changes. (which didn't work)
* Windsurf even created the POST handler - the next step
