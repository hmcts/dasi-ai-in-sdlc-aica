## INPUT
Can you remove the graceful shutdown handler please?

## OUTPUT
I'll help you remove the graceful shutdown handler. First, let me find where it's implemented in your codebase:

Let me try a different search term:

Now let me look at the server.ts file to see the graceful shutdown handler implementation:

Now I'll remove the graceful shutdown handler and the related code:

Now I need to check if there's any code related to the readiness check that might be affected by removing the shutdown flag:

Let me look at the health.ts file to see if we need to update the readiness checks:

Now I'll update the health.ts file to remove the shutdown check:

I've successfully removed the graceful shutdown handler from your application. Here's a summary of the changes made:

Removed the gracefulShutdownHandler function from server.ts
Removed the process event listeners (SIGINT and SIGTERM) that used this handler
Removed the app.locals.shutdown = false assignment since it's no longer needed
Updated the health check functionality to remove the shutdown check:
Removed the shutdownCheck function from health.ts
Removed the readinessChecks section that used this function
Made the same changes to the compiled JavaScript files (server.js and health.js)
Removed unused imports from the health files
These changes simplify the application by removing the graceful shutdown functionality, which will make the application terminate immediately when it receives termination signals rather than going through a graceful shutdown process.

The error you were seeing earlier about "Cannot find module 'path'" is a separate issue related to TypeScript type definitions. I see you've already added the @types/node package to your project's devDependencies in package.json, which should resolve that error.

## SUCCESS
Yes

## RESULT
Windsurf was very thorough in removing the graceful shutdown handler and related code.
Windsurf also edited this prompt file to record our changes.
