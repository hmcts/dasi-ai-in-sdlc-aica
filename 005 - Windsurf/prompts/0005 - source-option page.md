## INPUT
* The header should be `Do you know the name of the court or tribunal?`.
* The options should be:
  * `I have the name` - with a value of `yes`
  * `I do not have the name` - with a value of `no`
* There should be a continue button
* It will POST to its own route (e.g. `/search-option`)

## OUTPUT
I'll update the search/option.njk template to match your requirements, including the header, radio options, continue button, and POST form.

I've updated the search option page according to your requirements. Here's what I've done:

Updated the template with:
Changed the header to "Do you know the name of the court or tribunal?"
Added radio buttons for the two options: "I have the name" (value: yes) and "I do not have the name" (value: no)
Added a "Continue" button
Set up the form to POST to the /search-option route
Added error handling for when no option is selected
Updated the search.ts router to handle POST requests:
If "I have the name" is selected, it will redirect to /search-by-name (to be implemented)
If "I do not have the name" is selected, it will redirect to /search-by-location (to be implemented)
If no option is selected, it will show an error message
The form follows the GOV.UK Design System patterns for radio buttons and error handling. You can test the form by clicking the "Start now" button on the home page, which will take you to the search options page.

The browser preview is available above, or you can navigate to https://localhost:3100 in your browser.

Would you like me to make any adjustments to the search options page or implement the redirect pages (/search-by-name and /search-by-location)?

## SUCCESS
Yes

## RESULT
Successfully updated the search option page with the required form elements and added POST handling to the router.
