## INPUT
Please can we alter the page so that:
* The title reads `What do you want to do?`
* The first radio-button says `Find the nearest court or tribunal` - with a value of `nearest`.
* The second radio-button says `Find a court or tribunal to send documents to` with a value of `documents`
* The third radio-button says `Contact a court or tribunal to get an update on your application` with a value of `update`
* There is then a divider that says `or`
* The final radio-button says `It is not listed here` with a value of `not-listed`
* The enclosing `form` should POST to `/service-choose-action`

I've updated the choose-action.njk template and added a POST handler for the /service-choose-action route according to your requirements. Here's what I've done:

Updated the choose-action.njk template with:
Changed the title to "What do you want to do?"
Added the four radio buttons with the specified values:
"Find the nearest court or tribunal" (value: nearest)
"Find a court or tribunal to send documents to" (value: documents)
"Contact a court or tribunal to get an update on your application" (value: update)
"It is not listed here" (value: not-listed)
Added a divider with "or" between the third and fourth options
Set the form method to POST and the action to /service-choose-action
Added error handling for when no option is selected
Added a POST handler for the /service-choose-action route in search.ts that:
Checks if an option was selected
Redirects to the appropriate page based on the selected option:
nearest → /search-by-location
documents → /search-by-name
update → /update-application
not-listed → /not-listed
Shows an error message if no option was selected
The form follows the GOV.UK Design System patterns for radio buttons, dividers, and error handling. You can test this functionality by:

Going to the home page and clicking "Start now"
Selecting "I do not have the name" and clicking "Continue"
Selecting one of the options on the "What do you want to do?" page and clicking "Continue"
Alternatively, you can try submitting without selecting an option to see the error handling
The browser preview is available above, or you can navigate to https://localhost:3100 in your browser.

## RESULT
