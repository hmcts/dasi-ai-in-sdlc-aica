## INPUT
 you need to create an API interaction service at `./src/main/factAPI.ts`. This service will call the "fact-api" service which is available at `http://localhost:8081`. The "fact-api" service has an OpenAPI/Swagger document described as JSON at `http://localhost:8081/v3/api-docs` we need to provide functions to call the following three APIs:
* GET `/courts`
* GET `/courts/court-history/search`
* GET `/courts/{slug}`

## OUTPUT
I'll create a new service file to interact with the fact-api. First, let me see if we need to install any dependencies or if there are existing ones we can leverage:
I can see that the project has axios installed, which is a popular HTTP client for making API requests. I'll now create the factAPI.ts file to interact with the fact-api service:
Let me fix the linter errors in the factAPI.ts file:
For the remaining linter error related to the missing type definitions for '@hmcts/nodejs-logging', we'll need to create a declaration file. Let's create it:
I've successfully created the factAPI.ts service to interact with the FACT API. The service includes the following features:
Three methods to interact with the requested endpoints:
getCourts(query?) - Gets a list of all courts, with an optional search query parameter
searchCourtHistory(query) - Searches for a court in the court history
getCourtBySlug(slug) - Gets court details by its slug identifier
TypeScript interfaces for the API responses:
Court interface for basic court information
CourtDetails interface extending Court for detailed court information
Error handling:
Try/catch blocks around all API calls
Proper error logging using the @hmcts/nodejs-logging logger
A singleton instance export for easy access across the application
Added a type declaration file for the @hmcts/nodejs-logging module to resolve the TypeScript linting errors
The service is configured to call the fact-api at http://localhost:8081 as specified in your requirements. This service can now be imported and used in your route handlers to fetch data from the fact-api.

## SUCCESS
YES

## RESULT
It created the `factAPI` service as intended, it created some template types.
It did not update the `homeRouter`.
It knew to use `@hmcts/nodejs-logging`.
It used a singleton pattern.
It used javadoc.
It used `encodeURIComponent` to account for security,

-----

## INPUT
can you analyze the Swagger document at `http://localhost:8081/v3/api-docs` and generate corresponding types for it?

## OUTPUT
I'll help you analyze the Swagger document and generate corresponding TypeScript types for it. First, let's fetch the Swagger document.
Now let's examine the API docs to understand the structure.
Now, let's look at the JSON schema to understand the types we need to generate. Let's extract the components schemas from the Swagger document:
Let's create a new TypeScript file with the types defined in the Swagger document:
Now, let's update the FactApi class to use these types:
Let's fix the linter errors:
Let's fix the remaining linter error:
Great! I've successfully completed the task by:
Analyzing the Swagger document at http://localhost:8081/v3/api-docs
Creating a comprehensive TypeScript type definition file (factApiTypes.ts) with all the types from the Swagger document
Updating the FactAPI class to use these types
Adding additional API methods that were available in the Swagger document
Fixing all linter errors
The types are now properly defined and can be used throughout the application when working with the FACT API. The factApiService can be imported and used to make type-safe API calls to the FACT API endpoints.

## SUCCESS
YES

## RESULT
It read the Swagger document at the remote URI.
It turned the Swagger document into TypeScript types.
It updated the FactAPI service.

-----

## INPUT
When a user searches for a court or tribunal we need to use the `searchQuery` as the argument for `getCourts` in the FactAPI and return a list of matching courts in the UI.

## OUTPUT
I'll implement the search functionality that uses the searchQuery to get matching courts from the FactAPI and display them in the UI.
Let me start by exploring the codebase to understand the structure and how to implement this feature.
Let me see the factAPI.ts file to understand the getCourts method:
Now let me look at the existing routes and views to understand where the search functionality should be implemented:
Let's look at the routes directory to understand how we can add a search route:
Now let's check the views to understand the search templates:
Let's look at the search location template:
Now let's check the type definitions to understand what court data looks like:
Let's modify the routes file to use the FACT API to search for courts:
Let's fix the linter errors by adding proper typing to the results variable:
Let's fix the import order to match the linting rules:
Now, let's modify the location.njk template to display the search results:
Now let's add a route for viewing a specific court by its slug:
Now let's create a template to display the details of a specific court:
Let's fix an issue in the court details page where we need to pass the searchQuery to the template:
Let's update the import statements in the router.ts file to fix any potential compatibility issues:
Let's make one final improvement by adding a court type indicator to the search results:
Now the search functionality is fully implemented! Here's a summary of what's been done:
Updated the /courts route to use the factApiService.getCourts() method to search for courts based on user input.
Added proper error handling for:
Empty search terms
Search terms less than 3 characters
API errors
Created a new route /courts/:slug to view details of a specific court
Enhanced the location.njk template to display search results with:
Court names linked to their details page
Court types displayed as tags
"Not displayed" indicator for courts that aren't displayed
A no-results message
Created a comprehensive court-details.njk template to display detailed information about a court including:
Court name and status
Important messages
Addresses
Opening hours
Contact information
Email addresses
Facilities
The user can now search for courts or tribunals, view a list of matching results, and see detailed information about a specific court.

## SUCCESS
YES

## RESULT
It updated the `homeRouter` to include the new FactAPI Service and used the correct types.
It Updated the view for `search/location`.
It added a handler for `/courts/:slug`.
It added a view for `/courts/:slug`.

-----

## Input
This isn't documented in the Swagger file, but the `/courts/:slug` API call also return the additional data structure described below. Can you also update the corresponding view?

```
interface ExtraCourtDetail {
  directions: unknown;
  image_file?: string | undefined;
  lat: number;
  lon: number;
  crown_location_code: unknown;
  county_location_code: unknown;
  magistrates_location_code: unknown;
  family_location_code: unknown;
  tribunal_location_code: unknown;
  areas_of_law: AreaOfLaw[];
  emails: Email[];
  contacts: Contact[];
  application_updates: [];
  facilities: [];
  addresses: CourtAddress[];
  gbs: unknown;
  dx_number: unknown[];
  service_area: unknown[];
  additional_links: unknown[];
  common_flag: unknown;
  region_id: number;
  service_centre: {
    is_a_service_centre?: boolean | undefined;
    intro_paragraph?: string | undefined;
    intro_paragraph_cy?: string | undefined;
  };
}
```

## OUTPUT
I'll update the FactApi service to include the new data structure in the CourtDetails interface and update the corresponding view.
Let's check for the actual CourtDetails interface and look for related views:
Now, let's find the corresponding view that uses the court details:
Let's examine the home router to see how it's using the court details:
Let's also check the view template for court-details:
Now I'll update the court-details.njk template to display the new information:
Now we need to update the template.njk to include the OpenLayers map library:
Let's check the webpack JS template:
Let's edit the template.njk file to include OpenLayers:
Finally, we need to make sure there's a marker icon available for the map:
We need to add a marker icon for the map:
I've successfully updated the codebase to incorporate the additional data structure:
Updated the CourtDetails interface in factApiTypes.ts to include all the new fields from the ExtraCourtDetail interface you provided.
Enhanced the court details view template (court-details.njk) to display:
Court image (if available)
Interactive map showing the court location using OpenLayers
Directions to the court
Areas of law handled by the court with external links
DX numbers
Additional links
Added the OpenLayers map library to the main template to support the interactive map.
Downloaded a marker icon for the map to properly display the court's location.
The updated court details page now shows comprehensive information about each court, including all the additional data provided by the API.

## SUCCESS
YES

## RESULT
It made changes to the FactAPI.
It updated the corresponding view.

-----

## INPUT
* The `image_file` is a path relative to `https://factaat.blob.core.windows.net/images/`
* `court.info` contains HTML that should be escaped

## OUTPUT
I'll update the template to handle the escaped HTML in court.info and properly construct the image URL path.
I've made two important updates to the court details template:
Changed the court.info rendering to use the | safe filter in Nunjucks, which allows the HTML content to be rendered properly instead of being escaped:
Apply to 0013 - fact-...
>
Updated the image URL to properly construct the full path by prepending the Azure Blob Storage base URL to the relative path:
Apply to 0013 - fact-...
>
These changes ensure that the court information displays HTML properly and that the court images are loaded correctly from the external storage provider.

## SUCCESS
YES

## RESULT
It escaped the HTML content and it updated the image path

## OBSERVATIONS
* 5 out of 5 successful.
