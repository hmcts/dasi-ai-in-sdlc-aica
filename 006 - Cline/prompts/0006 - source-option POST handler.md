## INPUT
Can you add a POST route handler for `/search-option`, the payload is JSON with the result from a single radio-button called `know-name`.

When the value of `know-name` is `yes` then it should redirect to `/search-by-name`.
When the value of `know-name` is `no` then it should redirect to `/service-choose-action`.
Otherwise we should redirect to `/services/search-by-postcode`

## OUTPUT
I need to add a POST route handler for /search-option that processes a JSON payload with a radio button value and redirects based on that value. Let me analyze the relevant files to understand the context better.

First, let's look at the existing search routes file to understand the structure:

Now I see the existing search routes file. It currently only has a GET route for /search-option that renders the 'search/option' view. I need to add a POST route handler for the same path.

Let's also look at the option.njk file to understand the form structure:

Now I have a better understanding of the form structure. The form has a radio button group with the name "know-name" and two possible values: "yes" or "no". The form is submitted via POST method.

Based on the requirements:

When the value of know-name is yes, redirect to /search-by-name
When the value of know-name is no, redirect to /service-choose-action
Otherwise, redirect to /services/search-by-postcode
Now I need to update the search.ts file to add the POST route handler. I'll use the replace_in_file tool to add the new route handler while preserving the existing GET route.

I've successfully added the POST route handler for /search-option to the search.ts file. The handler:

Extracts the 'know-name' value from the request body
Redirects to '/search-by-name' if the value is 'yes'
Redirects to '/service-choose-action' if the value is 'no'
Redirects to '/services/search-by-postcode' for any other value
Now I can use the attempt_completion tool to inform the user that the task has been completed.


Task Completed
I've added the POST route handler for /search-option to handle the form submission. The handler:

Extracts the 'know-name' value from the request body
Redirects to '/search-by-name' when the value is 'yes'
Redirects to '/service-choose-action' when the value is 'no'
Redirects to '/services/search-by-postcode' for any other value
The implementation follows the requirements exactly, handling all three possible scenarios for the radio button selection.

## SUCCESS
YES

## RESULT
Cline made the change exactly as requested
